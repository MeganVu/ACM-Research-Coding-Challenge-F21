## [](https://github.com/ACM-Research/Coding-Challenge-F21#no-collaboration-policy)No Collaboration Policy

**You may not collaborate with anyone on this challenge.**  You  _are_  allowed to use Internet documentation. If you  _do_  use existing code (either from Github, Stack Overflow, or other sources),  **please cite your sources in the README**.

## [](https://github.com/ACM-Research/Coding-Challenge-F21#submission-procedure)Submission Procedure

Please follow the below instructions on how to submit your answers.

1.  Create a  **public**  fork of this repo and name it  `ACM-Research-Coding-Challenge-F21`. To fork this repo, click the button on the top right and click the "Fork" button.

2.  Clone the fork of the repo to your computer using  `git clone [the URL of your clone]`. You may need to install Git for this (Google it).

3.  Complete the Challenge based on the instructions below.

4.  Submit your solution by filling out this [form](https://acmutd.typeform.com/to/zF1IcBGR).

## Assessment Criteria 

Submissions will be evaluated holistically and based on a combination of effort, validity of approach, analysis, adherence to the prompt, use of outside resources (encouraged), promptness of your submission, and other factors. Your approach and explanation (detailed below) is the most weighted criteria, and partial solutions are accepted.

[Sentiment analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentiment_analysis) is a natural language processing technique that computes a sentiment score for a body of text. This sentiment score can quantify how positive, negative, or neutral the text is. The following dataset in  `input.txt`  contains a relatively large body of text.

**Determine an overall sentiment score of the text in this file, explain what this score means, and contrast this score with what you expected.**  If your solution also provides different metrics about the text (magnitude, individual sentence score, etc.), feel free to add it to your explanation.   

**You may use any programming language you feel most comfortable. We recommend Python because it is the easiest to implement. You're allowed to use any library/API you want to implement this**, just document which ones you used in this README file. Try to complete this as soon as possible as submissions are evaluated on a rolling basis.

Regardless if you can or cannot answer the question, provide a short explanation of how you got your solution or how you think it can be solved in your README.md file. However, we highly recommend giving the challenge a try, you just might learn something new!

## Solution
The value returned by this program is a sentiment score. In the documentation for the library used, the polarity score is between -1 and 1 where 1 is the most positive and -1 is the most negative. This matches the description that was given in the instructions. Since the score was around 0.21 or 20%, it means that the text was somewhat positive, but close to neutral. Since the text had a mix of words with positive and negative connotations, I expected the text to be about as close to neutral as it was. In order to solve this, I used the documentation for TextBlob, a library designed for NLP. I originally searched for libraries related to sentiment analysis. Most of the results inolved training a model, but this would involve finding a training data set with similar context to the actual data. Since I was unable to find a training set specific for this purpose, it was better to use a library that did not require training of the model. TextBlob had a feature that served this purpose, so it is what I used.
